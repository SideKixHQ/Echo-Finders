          Everything you see is driven by <code>WalkSession</code> from{" "}
          <code>@echofinders/core</code>, the same code an iOS build would run. Only the GPS
          chip is faked, and position comes from <code>RouteProfile</code> — so the traveller
          idles before setting off, slows on arrival, and actually stands still at the stops
          the route declares.
        </p>
        <p>
          Switching mode changes nothing about the code path. It swaps one row of{" "}
          <code>MODE_PRESETS</code> for another: corridor width, timing tolerance,
          talk-to-silence ratio, position source and package budget. A flight looks eighty
          kilometres either side of the track and will play an echo ten minutes from its
          place; on foot that is three hundred metres and ninety seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Echoes are sealed until you arrive. Step inside one and the ring fills over twelve
          seconds; when it closes, the echo opens, and then it waits. Finding one and hearing
          it are separate acts: arriving collects it, pressing play is a decision. Starting
          narration unasked talks over a conversation, a podcast, or somebody standing in a
          memorial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which is what <b>Plan</b> is for. Sit down before you set off, look at everything
          the route passes, pick a few, and switch on "play these as I reach them". Auto-play
          without that step is an imposition — twelve echoes is forty minutes of narration,
          and handing somebody all of it because they once tapped a switch is how a product
          becomes something people turn off. Choosing first makes the same switch an
          agreement about a known quantity, which is why the running total is at the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing ever interrupts: the next starts only when the last has finished. Echoes
          you did not pick still open and still join your collection — they simply do not
          talk. And <b>Coming up</b> on the map offers the next couple with their lead times,
          which matters most in the air, where you cannot go to an echo and choosing what to
          hear before it goes past is the whole interaction.
        </p>
        {selfDirected ? (
          <p>
            <b>Turn your sound on.</b> As you close on a sealed echo you will hear it — a
            note followed by quieter repeats of itself, slow and spread out when you are far
            away, tightening as you approach, and at the moment of arrival a single clean
            note with no reflection at all, because you are standing at the source. The bar
            above the sheet is the same cue rendered as the haptic you would feel through a
            pocket. One proximity model, two ways of expressing it.
          </p>
        ) : (
          <p>
            No guidance bar and no sound here, which is the point. Guidance answers{" "}
            <i>which way should I go</i>, and a passenger cannot divert an aircraft towards a
            good story. The engine still computes proximity — the map wants it — it simply
            stops telling your body about it. A car gets the full cue, because a navigator
            can say "turn left here".
          </p>
        )}
        <p>
          <b>It talks.</b> Nothing has been through ElevenLabs yet, so the narration is your
          browser reading the actual script aloud. It is flat and its timing is not the real
          timing — but the words are the real words, which is the only way to judge writing
          that is heard rather than read. When the real renders land, this file is replaced
          by twenty lines around an <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element and nothing else
          changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two echoes capturing at once is the normal case, not the edge one — the stops on
          this route exist so a listener can collect both the King George statue and the
          Charging Bull at Bowling Green. One plays, the other waits, and neither talks over
          the other. Walk far enough while something waits and it gives up: capturing and
          hearing are different things, and nothing is lost, because it is in the collection.
